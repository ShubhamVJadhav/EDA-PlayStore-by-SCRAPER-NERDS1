Think of any problem you are facing in your life, you will find a solution of same in form of an app specially curated to fix the issue for you.  As per latest Google Play stats, there are 3.48 million apps currently at the Google Play Store. The number is constantly rising as around 3,739 apps are added to the Play Store every single day. \n","\n","Due to constant rising numbers of apps, it becomes imperative to understand the parameters and patterns related to app creation from a business point of view. The Play store datasets are quite intriguing as they consist of details like number of installations, app reviews, sentiment ploarity and so on. In this project we digged deeper into the datasets by doing an Exploratory Data Analysis to see certain patterns that can be helpful to different category of businesses. \n","\n","We began by in-depth cleaning of the datasets and then we merged them to create one dataset. After that we did a generalised analysis to get numerous insights. We particularly focussed on the customer behaviour and what components affect the decision of the user to install the app.  With the information gathered, we further tried to see if for medical category creating an app would be benefical. If so, what kinds of apps have a higher probability of being liked by the audience. \n"],"metadata":{"id":"FJNUwmbgGyua"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# <u>**GitHub Link**</u>"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# <u>**Problem Statement**</u>\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Google Playstore in order to understand the trends and patterns in app downloads, user ratings, and revenue generated by apps.

One important inside we get with respect to the size of the app is that as the size of the application increases the installation of the app descrease.

Content rating also affect the user engagement as more restructed your content rating is the more restricted your user engagement. So try to keep user rating as <b>\"Everone\"</b>.\n","7. Make sure the app will get the update at regular interval, as it's an important factor for user engagement and performance of the application. In our analysis we seen that most of the apps will get their app update at <b>Jully month</b>.\n","8. As we seen form subjectivity most of the reviews as the objective, So for successful apps it's more important to keep eye on the user reviews and early resolution of the problems.\n","9. We also seen from our analysis that there is strong relationship between Install and reviews. for the new apps reviews are the important tool for increase the user engagement.\n","10.
